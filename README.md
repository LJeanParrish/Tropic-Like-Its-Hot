## Background

Tropic Like It's Hot captured weather data from approximately 500 cities at different lattitudes from the equator.  The objective was to create a dashboard reflecting analysis I performed on different weather phenomena and develop a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Individual pages were created for each plot and links created to faciliatat navigation between those plots. These pages contained the visualizations and their corresponding analysis.  I also created a landing page, a comparison page to reflect all of the plots, and another page showing the underlying data.

### Website Requirements


The website included of 7 pages with schematics detailed below:

* A Landing Page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking on an image navigates to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons page that:
  * Contained all visualizations on the same page for easy comparison.
  * Used a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be able to adjust for screen size. 
* A Data page that:
  * Displayed a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table utilized Bootstrap components. 
    * The data levereaged an exported `.csv` file that was converted to HTML using Pandas.
* The website contained a navigation menu that:
  * Had the name of the site on the left allowing users to return to the landing page from any page.
  * Contained a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar that provided links to each visualization page.
  * Provided two text links for the "Comparisons" and "Data" pages.
  * Was responsive (uses media queries).
